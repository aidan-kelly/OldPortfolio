                    Hello again. It has been a while since I last updated this website but I am back with a firey passion.
                    Recently I have been taking a Udemy course on Android developlment in order to have more side projects to put on my resume.
                    I have gotten about 30% of the way done as of now. I haven't pushed anything to my Google Play store yet but I have a few of
                    the class projects on my <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly">Github</a>. I have kind of taken a break on web development as
                    Android has stolen my interest. I hope to see you again soon.
                </p>

                <p>Welcome! The last little bit of my life has been spent getting this site up and running. 
                    I have learned a lot in the process. I now feel a lot more comfortable working with HTML and CSS, there is still loads
                    to learn but this is a fantastic start. I plan on finishing my clone of the Google Homepage within the next couple of 
                    days and then begin learning about Javascript. Very exciting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Still no internship... I started applying super early this year to no avail. I learned that I should focus on sending
                    applications out to local companies instead of hoping that one of the Big N would take me on. Lesson learned, next year will
                    be different. I am currently trying to create more. Work on more projects and learn more in general so that I will be a 
                    more attractive candidate in the future. I plan on creating lots of websites and playing around with Python some more once
                    I feel confident in my web dev skills. Thanks for reading! Until next time.
