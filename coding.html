                    Hello hello hello! I have to decided to skip the order of the Udemy course 
                    in favour of just trying to build my own stuff and researching what I need 
                    to complete that task. I am currently starting work on my D&D initiative 
                    tracker and am very excited about it. I can create things that I thought were 
                    impossible a couple of months ago. And I think once I get this app finished and 
                    released on the Play store, people will use it. And that is really neat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have also been trying to contribute to open source for Hacktoberfest, so far I 
                    only have 2 contributions but I am constantly looking for repos that I can help 
                    out in. My problem currently is that most of these repos use JS and I am not 
                    completely fluent in JS currently. I also don't know about all the different 
                    frameworks and where they all fit in. So that can be a research project for 
                    this weekend to help me feel more comfortable in those environments. 
                </p>

                    It's finally October and October means its time for Hacktoberfest!!! AKA, Aidan makes a fool of himself by making bad OSS contributions 
                    in an attempt to get stickers and a free shirt. In all seriousness though I do want to get the t-shirt. And since I have started to understand 
                    Git more thorough manner, I think it would be a good learning experience (and it would look good on my resume üòâ). I have already made one 
                    pull request but it was on a repo for making your first pull requst. I think I may struggle finding things I can actually help with.

                    In my Android developlment journey I am learning about using Google Maps within my apps. I honestly don't think I will use it anytime soon 
                    but it is nice to know. I can't do anything crazy with it yet but I am always moving forward. I am excited to keep developing and hopefully 
                    create something I feel is worthy of pushing to the Google Play Store. When that happens I will be updating you all along the way. Thanks for 
                    reading! Later!

                    Bonjour! Yesterday and today were quite productive. I have gotten back into the swing of writing HTML and CSS as well as I did
                    before and I finished another application! The Udemy course had us make an app that used the OpenWeatherMap API to create a simple
                    weather app. I had never worked with JSON or APIs before so this was a very useful experience. The final product can be found
                    <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/Whats-The-Weather">here</a>. I made my own changes to their challenge by having the app
                    also display the temperature in the location the user specifies. Next up is learning about maps and geolocations in regards to
                    android development. After that is what I really want to learn, permanent data storage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to create an app that manages a Dungeon Master's encounters during a game of Dungeons and Dragons. I already have a 
                    mock up of this in pure Java on my Github (<a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/DnD_Initiative_Counter">Link here</a>), but I want a 
                    version of this on Android. My ideal application would allow a DM to create Encounters in advance and then save them on the phone 
                    until they are ready to play the Encounter. In order to do this though I have to learn about permanent data storage techniques. 
                    I will get there soon enough though. Later!

                    Hello again. It has been a while since I last updated this website but I am back with a firey passion.
                    Recently I have been taking a Udemy course on Android developlment in order to have more side projects to put on my resume.
                    I have gotten about 30% of the way done as of now. I haven't pushed anything to my Google Play store yet but I have a few of
                    the class projects on my <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly">Github</a>. I have kind of taken a break on web development as
                    Android has stolen my interest. I hope to see you again soon.
                </p>

                <p>Welcome! The last little bit of my life has been spent getting this site up and running. 
                    I have learned a lot in the process. I now feel a lot more comfortable working with HTML and CSS, there is still loads
                    to learn but this is a fantastic start. I plan on finishing my clone of the Google Homepage within the next couple of 
                    days and then begin learning about Javascript. Very exciting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Still no internship... I started applying super early this year to no avail. I learned that I should focus on sending
                    applications out to local companies instead of hoping that one of the Big N would take me on. Lesson learned, next year will
                    be different. I am currently trying to create more. Work on more projects and learn more in general so that I will be a 
                    more attractive candidate in the future. I plan on creating lots of websites and playing around with Python some more once
                    I feel confident in my web dev skills. Thanks for reading! Until next time.
