                <p>Welcome! The last little bit of my life has been spent getting this site up and running. 
                    I have learned a lot in the process. I now feel a lot more comfortable working with HTML and CSS, there is still loads
                    to learn but this is a fantastic start. I plan on finishing my clone of the Google Homepage within the next couple of 
                    days and then begin learning about Javascript. Very exciting.
                </p>

                    Still no internship... I started applying super early this year to no avail. I learned that I should focus on sending
                    applications out to local companies instead of hoping that one of the Big N would take me on. Lesson learned, next year will
                    be different. I am currently trying to create more. Work on more projects and learn more in general so that I will be a 
                    more attractive candidate in the future. I plan on creating lots of websites and playing around with Python some more once
                    I feel confident in my web dev skills. Thanks for reading! Until next time.
