            <h1>Web Development</h1>

            <p>
                I have been trying to learn web development for a long time now. Browsing through my 
                GitHub account will present you with three different attempts I have made to create 
                myself an eye catching portfolio website. I think I have finally achieved that goal 
                however and created a portfolio that I am proud of. Bellow you will find links to 
                the web development projects I have created. 
            </p>

                <h2><a href="web_dev_projects/security-page/index.html" target="_blank">Security Website</a></h2>
                <p>
                    In the Fall of 2019 I had the pleasure of taking a university course on computer security 
                    and the basics of binary exploitation. I fell in love with the subject and decided to 
                    create a simple website talking about it, in order to relearn the basics of HTML and CSS.

                <h2><a href="web_dev_projects/calculator/calculator.html" target="_blank">Javascript Calculator</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a simple Javascript Calculator I created to help me learn how to connect 
                    my HTML with Javascript in order to create interactive websites.

                <h2><a href="https://aidan-chat.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Chatroom</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This is my chatroom that I created using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and Socket.io. I also chose 
                    to host it on Heroku so that I would be able to get my friends to test it out with me.
