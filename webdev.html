            <h1>Web Development</h1>

            <p>
                I have been trying to learn web development for a long time now. Browsing through my 
                GitHub account will present you with three different attempts I have made to create 
                myself an eye catching portfolio website. I think I have finally achieved that goal 
                however and created a portfolio that I am proud of. Bellow you will find links to 
                the web development projects I have created. 
            </p>

                <h2><a href="web_dev_projects/security-page/index.html" target="_blank">Security Website</a></h2>
                <p>
                    In the Fall of 2019 I had the pleasure of taking a university course on computer security 
                    and the basics of binary exploitation. I fell in love with the subject and decided to 
                    create a simple website talking about it, in order to relearn the basics of HTML and CSS.

                <h2><a href="web_dev_projects/calculator/calculator.html" target="_blank">Javascript Calculator</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a simple Javascript Calculator I created to help me learn how to connect 
                    my HTML with Javascript in order to create interactive websites.

                <h2><a href="https://aidan-chat.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Chatroom</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This is my chatroom that I created using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and Socket.io. I also chose 
                    to host it on Heroku so that I would be able to get my friends to test it out with me. 
                </p>

                <h2><a href="https://connect-4-aidan.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Connect 4</a></h2>
                <p>
                   To test my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS, I decided to try to create a multiplayer game. 
                   Using Socket.io and nodeJS, I managed to make a basic clone of Connect 4 that is 
                   able to hold at least 5 concurrent games. I also deployed this on Heroku, this time 
                   however I used Heroku's GitHub integration to make the process more efficient.

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/Bookshelf" target="_blank">Bookshelf</a></h2>
                <p>
                    A project that I am currently developing. It is a simple book management system 
                    that allows friends to borrow books from each other and share reviews. Created 
                    with HTML, CSS, JS, and PostgreSQL, I am hoping to have this complete in the next two months.
