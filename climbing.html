                    Today was a bouldering day. And a mediocre one at that. I already hate bouldering and I wasn't able to make much progress on many of 
                    the routes I attempted today. Also none of my friends were able to make it out. They have become less and less reliable for climbing 
                    as of late. Hopefully their interest spikes again too. There used to be 4 of us climbing everytime but now we average 3 which makes it 
                    difficult to do any roped climbing. Which is my favorite. So instead we have been doing a bunch of bouldering.
                </p>

                    I did manage to make a bit of progress on a crimpy c5 which was giving me troubles before. I can make it to the second last hold before 
                    I lose my footing and fall. I believe I will send it next bouldering trip though.

                    It's been a long time since I've updated this. My ankle is back to normal and I am back to climbing. In the time since 
                    I wrote here last, my friends and I have improved a ton. We have managed to go from top roping 5.9's to leading some 5.11-'s
                    and all 5.10s.
                    I also bought a lot of my own outdoor climbing gear and we were able to climb on some real rock! It was a lot of fun and got me 
                    hooked into climbing outdoors. We went to Sunshine Slabs, just outside of Banff.

                <p>
                    My goals now are to be able to climb 5.11 comfortably before the winter ends so that when spring time comes around, I'll
                    be able to climb really hard outdoors. Right now we are doing a pretty even split of both bouldering and lead climbing. We no
                    longer top rope. I hope to keep you updated more regularily on my climbing adventures. For now I will leave you with a video of me 
                    falling hard while bouldering. Thanks for reading!

                        I sprained my ankle, really really badly. On April 26, 2018 I was celebrating the end of exams by skateboarding
                        in my drive way. I was learning how to kickflip when I rolled my ankle inwards, creating an audible pop sound.
                        I spent the next 5 days utilizing RICE to heal...the swelling didn't go down. On May 1, 2018 I decided to go see a 
                        walk-in doctor to ensure my ankle was on an upward trajectory. He says he doesn't think it is broken but sends me to
                        get an x-ray regardless. X-ray goes well, doctor there says my ankle is all good. I go home happy. Later that day the 
                        walk-in doctor phones me saying that it is broken and to go to Urgent Care asap. Turns out in football years ago, I sprained
                        my ankle so badly that the ligament had pulled out a bone chip from my ankle. They give me an aircast and send me home.
                        I am now waiting for another week before I can finally climb again.

                        The waiting is insanely painful. My birthday was May 7th and everything I got was related to climbing. I have to wait
                        for May 15th before I can climb, and even then I am going to need to wear an ankle brace. Should be a blast though once I 
                        get back, for my birthday I received a GriGri, a harness and some carabiners so I will finally be able to try sport climbing
                        instead of only bouldering! Cannot wait!!
