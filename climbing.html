                    <p>
                        I sprained my ankle, really really badly. On April 26, 2018 I was celebrating the end of exams by skateboarding
                        in my drive way. I was learning how to kickflip when I rolled my ankle inwards, creating an audible pop sound.
                        I spent the next 5 days utilizing RICE to heal...the swelling didn't go down. On May 1, 2018 I decided to go see a 
                        walk-in doctor to ensure my ankle was on an upward trajectory. He says he doesn't think it is broken but sends me to
                        get an x-ray regardless. X-ray goes well, doctor there says my ankle is all good. I go home happy. Later that day the 
                        walk-in doctor phones me saying that it is broken and to go to Urgent Care asap. Turns out in football years ago, I sprained
                        my ankle so badly that the ligament had pulled out a bone chip from my ankle. They give me an aircast and send me home.
                        I am now waiting for another week before I can finally climb again.

                        The waiting is insanely painful. My birthday was May 7th and everything I got was related to climbing. I have to wait
                        for May 15th before I can climb, and even then I am going to need to wear an ankle brace. Should be a blast though once I 
                        get back, for my birthday I received a GriGri, a harness and some carabiners so I will finally be able to try sport climbing
                        instead of only bouldering! Cannot wait!!

                    It's been a long time since I've updated this. My ankle is back to normal and I am back to climbing.
