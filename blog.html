            <p>
                I'm currently trying to revamp my portfolio as being in the workforce for the past
                four years has definitely shifted my focus away from it. That doesn't mean that I haven't been
                working on projects though. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately at work I've been working on learning video game development using Godot as my game engine.
                While I haven't made anything major, I've been starting at the beginning, learning the basics by 
                recreating classic favourites like <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/Asteroids-Clone">Asteroids</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/Pac-Man-Clone">Pac-Man</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Going forwards I hope to use this blog as a place to store what I learn during this process. I'll share updates 
                on progress and discuss any problems that I run into. I look forward to posting more in the future. 
            </p>
