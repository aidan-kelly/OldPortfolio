            <h1>Godot Pac-Man progress</h1>
            <h2>December 6, 2024</h2>
            
            <p>
                Today was a professional development day at work for me, so I've been trying to finish off my Pac-Man clone.

            <p>
                Spent a lot of time working on implementing the UI flow between the different menus. I had 
                some experience with this from my previous Asteroids clone project.

            <p>
                The hardest feature to implement today though was the score board. I utilized the Godot FileAccess class 
                to handle the file I/O, which was something I hadn't tried yet in Godot. The built in methods man it ridiculously easy. However, 
                originally I had tried to create my own class in Godot to store the score records. Godot wasn't playing nice, and currently doesn't have 
                structs built in. After quite a bit of debugging, I resigned to representing the score records as Dictionaries which worked without issue.

            <h1>A new beginning.</h1>
            <h2>December 3, 2024</h2>
            
            <p>
                I'm currently trying to revamp my portfolio as being in the workforce for the past
                four years has definitely shifted my focus away from it. That doesn't mean that I haven't been
                working on projects though. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately at work I've been working on learning video game development using Godot as my game engine.
                While I haven't made anything major, I've been starting at the beginning, learning the basics by 
                recreating classic favourites like <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/Asteroids-Clone">Asteroids</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/aidan-kelly/Pac-Man-Clone">Pac-Man</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Going forwards I hope to use this blog as a place to store what I learn during this process. I'll share updates 
                on progress and discuss any problems that I run into. I look forward to posting more in the future.
